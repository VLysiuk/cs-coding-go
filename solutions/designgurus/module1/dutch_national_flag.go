	Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
	You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
	The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue;
	and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
